# Riven Torq: Quantum Horizons — Canonical Lore

This project uses the Quantum Horizon setting as its canonical universe. All gameplay, factions,
biomes, bosses, activities, and artifacts are aligned to this lore.

## World Overview
- Fractured multiverse of intersecting realities; jurisdictions shift like quantum particles.
- Drifting megacities, orbital stations, fragmented planetary systems, quantum-torn corridors.
- Lawless frontier of innovation and survival; complex interdimensional economics and politics.

## History
- 0 QD: Quantum Divergence — catastrophic dimensional fracturing from quantum navigation tests.
- Fragmentation Era (100–250 QD): centralized governance collapses; para-legal economies rise.
- Broker Wars (250–350 QD): faction conflicts; Parallax Concord forms; inter-reality legal frameworks.
- Adaptive Period (350–Present): stabilization, adaptation tech, specialized economic niches.

## Factions
- Parallax Concord: inter-dimensional regulatory body; capture-alive statutes, extradition protocols.
- Free Archipelagos: decentralized economic network; fluid bounties, flexible sapience classes.
- Brass Arc Cartel: clandestine acquisition consortium; specimen collection, covert research.
- Shard Tribunal: quasi-judicial authority; geometry-based legal interpretations, selective enforcement.

## Key Figures
- Riven Torq: gene-spliced tracker; spectral tracking implant, micro-accelerant blood, adaptive pupils.
- The Lumen Scribe: phototrophic oracle; future projection via living crystal; glyph communication.

## Locations
- The Kettle: worm-torn interdimensional slum; underground hub; constant spatial/legal flux.
- Hull-Markets: interdimensional trade zones; rare bio/tech commodities.
- Orbital Scrapyards: technological graveyards; salvage ecosystems and rare components.

## Entities
- Sentient Sands, Bioluminescent Specimens, Quantum Parasites.

## Beliefs
- Neon Saints Cult: worship tech intermediaries; quantum consciousness; ritual tech signs.
- Philosophies: quantum determinism, adaptive consciousness, inter-reality connectivity.

## Tech & Artifacts
- Quantum navigation, augmentations, adaptive legal-economic systems, bioluminescent comms.
- Biolumen Crystals (future-projection), Quantum Licenses (inter-reality legal docs), Adaptive Implant Modules.

## Gameplay Pillars
- Interdimensional navigation; adaptive character development; legal/economic interaction systems; reality manipulation.
- Progression via faction reputation, augmentations, exploration, and strategic economics/legal play.
